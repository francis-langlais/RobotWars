# RobotWars
Unreal version of RobotWar laboratory for RMCC. Updated to work with UE 4.25. There are directive on how to setup the project (in French) at ./RobotWars/Directive.docx. There's also the math behind how the futur position and orientation are calculated at ./RobotWars/References.

The project contains bugs since it wasn't finished but nothing that prevent it from running.
